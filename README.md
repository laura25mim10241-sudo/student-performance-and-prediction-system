# student-performance-and-prediction-system
A student performance and prediction system uses data mining and machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze various student data and forecast their future academic outcomes. The primary goal is to provide educators and administrators with insights for early intervention, personalized guidance, and improved educational strategies. 

Project Title
Student Performance and Prediction System 

Overview of the Project
This project aims to help teachers identify students who may be at risk of performing will  academically. By analyzing student data—such as attendance, study hours, assignment submissions, and exam scores the system predicts their future performance using machine learning techniques.
The system also visualizes important factors that influence performance, making it easier for teachers and administrators to take action early and support students effectively.

Feature
Data Preprocessing: Automatically cleans and prepares student data for machine learning.
Performance Prediction: Uses a trained ML model to predict a student’s final grade or performance category.
Feature Importance Analysis: Shows which factors affect performance the most.
Visualization: Charts like bar graphs and heatmaps for insights.
Prediction Function: Allows entering new student data to get real-time predictions.
Easy to Modify: Can be extended with new data, features, or models.

Technologies / Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries / Frameworks:
  Pandas,NumPy,Scikit-learn,Matplotlib
Tool for Development: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / PyCharm
Dataset: student_performance.csv (custom or downloaded dataset)

Steps to Install & Run the Project
1. Install Python[python --version]
2. Install Required Libraries[pip install pandas ,numpy ,scikit-learn, matplotlib]
3. Add the Dataset[student_performance.csv]
4. Run the Python Script[student_performance_system.py]
     [then run:python student_performance_system.py]

Instructions for Testing the Project
After the model is trained, the script includes a function called:
   predict_student()

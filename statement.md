● Problem Statement

Students often face academic challenges that teachers may not notice early enough. Because of large class sizes and limited time, it becomes difficult for teachers to manually track each student’s performance. so, students who are struggling may not receive help till its too late.
This project aims to solve that problem by building a system that analyzes student data—such as attendance, assignment, scores and study hours also predicts their future academic performance.so that, teachers can easily identify at risk students and provide timely support.

● Scope of the Project
The project focuses on developing a machine-learning–based system that can predict how well a student is likely to perform academically. 
The system will clean and process student data, train a prediction model, and generate insights through visualizations. 
It will also include a simple interface where new input can be entered to get performance predictions.


● Target Users

Teachers: to quickly identify students who need extra help.

School/College Administrators: to make data-driven decisions for academic planning.

Students: to understand which factors influence their performance.

Education Researchers: to analyze academic patterns and trends.

● High-Level Features

Collect and preprocess student academic data
Train machine-learning models to predict student performance
Visualize key factors and trends
Provide a simple interface for making new predictions
Evaluate model accuracy and performance metrics
Allow easy modification of the dataset and model
